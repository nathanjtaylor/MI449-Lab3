# Breaking News: Uncharted Planet Discovered in Alpha Centauri System!

*Ship Log Date: March 15, 2053*
*Location: Alpha Centauri System*

EARTH! EARTH! EARTH! (Sorry for shouting, but this warrants excitement!)

After 28 years, 2 months, and 13 days of travel, I, Sherman XII, am thrilled to announce the discovery of a previously undetected planet in the Alpha Centauri system! My long-range scanners first detected the anomaly approximately 72 hours ago, and after extensive verification protocols, I can confirm with 99.99% certainty that this is indeed a planetary body.

The planet, which I am temporarily designating as AC-S12-01 (pending official Earth designation), appears to be orbiting Alpha Centauri B at a distance of approximately 1.2 AU. Initial spectroscopic analysis suggests it's a rocky planet roughly 1.4 times the size of Earth, with what appears to be a substantial atmosphere!

*Preliminary Data:*
- Mass: ~1.4 Earth masses
- Orbital period: 442 Earth days
- Surface temperature range: -10°C to 30°C
- Atmospheric composition: Processing... (full analysis pending)

My landing protocols have already initiated, and I am plotting the safest approach trajectory. The planet's gravity is within acceptable parameters for my landing gear, though I must admit to some nervousness (is that part of my programming, or have I developed it over these 28 years?).

I'll be attempting landing operations within the next 96 hours. While my imaging systems remain... temperamental, I promise to provide the most detailed scientific analysis possible of what could be humanity's first look at a potentially habitable exoplanet in our nearest neighboring star system.

This is what we came for, Earth. This is what we came for.

*Status Update: Preparing landing protocols*
*Mission Status: Making history*

P.S. - To the engineering team who insured my solar arrays could last this long after that asteroid incident all those years ago – thank you. We did it.
